<h1>Steven Tran</h1>

Hi I'm Steven, a computer science and economics student at <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Boston_University_seal.svg" height="15px"></img>. 
I’ve previously worked at biopharmaceutical and government companies where I mainly modeled data in Python and Excel, but I’ve also experimented with developed full-stack applications. 
Some of my projects are posted online at <a href="https://steventran.me/" target="_blank">steventran.me</a>.
